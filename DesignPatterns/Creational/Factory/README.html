    <p>
        The factory completely abstracts the creation and initialization of the product from the client. This indirection enables the client to focus on its discrete role in the application without concerning itself with the details of how the product is created. Thus, as the product implementation changes over time, the client remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>remove explicit association (coupling) between the creator and created classes</li>
        <li>use of a specialized object solely to create other objects</li>
    </ul>
