# ProjectEuler
The ProjectEuler repository contains solutions of my own design written in C# for various problems on the ProjectEuler (https://projecteuler.net) web site. It also includes a BigInt class and a small, general purpose math library that I've designed to perform common tasks such as the factoring of large numbers, sequence generation, etc.
