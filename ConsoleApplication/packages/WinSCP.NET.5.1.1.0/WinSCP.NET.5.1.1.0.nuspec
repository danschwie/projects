    <description>The WinSCP .NET assembly winscp.dll is a .NET wrapper around WinSCP’s scripting interface that allows your code to connect to a remote machine and manipulate remote files over SFTP, SCP, and FTP sessions from .NET languages, such as C#, VB.NET, PowerShell and others, or from environments supporting .NET addons, such as SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

The assembly is also exposed to COM, and as such it can be used from variety of other programming languages and development environments–e.g., WSH-hosted active scripting languages like JScript and VBScript, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), Perl, and Python.</description>
